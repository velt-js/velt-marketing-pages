    question: "What is a MAD (Monthly Active Document)?",
    answer:
      "An active document is a unique document that has CRUD operations performed on it by any Velt Feature during the month.\n\nNote: This excludes documents that were merely initiated without any CRUD operations being performed on features like comments, notifications, CRDT, etc.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between MAR and MAD, and why does it matter for my bill?",
    answer:
      "MAR (Monthly Active Room): A room (document) counts as active when a user connects to it during the billing month. A room is also considered active when its content is updated: comments, realtime data storage, etc.\n\nMAD (Monthly Active Document): We use this. A more specific metric representing documents where users actively utilize Velt's collaboration features within your application during a month.\n\nMAD is a subset of MAR. Typically, about 20% of MARs perform meaningful collaboration actions on average. This varies by product category, with some higher or lower.\n\nVelt's MAD-based pricing ensures you're billed only for users who derive value from our collaboration features, offering a more cost-effective and transparent alternative to MAR-based models.",
  },
