// Global 404 page — Next.js renders this automatically for routes outside
// any layout that already provides chrome. Routes inside the (features)
// route group have their own colocated not-found.tsx that omits the Nav
// (since (features)/layout.tsx already renders one), preventing the double-
// Nav we'd otherwise get for unknown root-level URLs.
